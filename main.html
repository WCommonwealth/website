    <h2>About W Commonwealth</h2>
    <p>The W Commonwealth, founded on September 4, 2021, by Vlad and Victor, is a private organization born from a bold vision. At just 11 years old, these pioneers created the Walar language—a unique system of characters designed for unbreakable privacy during their school days. Our mission? To master crypto, technology, and privacy, building a financial empire that ensures freedom and wealth.</p>
    <p>With a 50/50 crypto wallet secured by a 3-of-4 device signature system, we stack Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and more, aiming for big wealth. Our tools, like W-Encrypt, empower secure communication, making us a fortress of innovation.</p>

  <!-- Walar Language Section -->
  <section id="walar">
    <h2>Walar Language: The Code of Silence</h2>
    <p>In 2021, Vlad and Victor, at the tender age of 11, invented Walar—a revolutionary language with unique characters that allow private communication undetectable by outsiders. Developed during school hours, this cryptic system became the foundation of our privacy ethos. Each character is a symbol of secrecy, crafted to protect our thoughts from prying eyes.</p>
    <p>Today, Walar is more than a language; it’s a cultural artifact of our organization, used to encode messages that only the initiated can decipher. Explore its beauty and power with our resources below.</p>
